This code contains a python based simulation of a non linear observer to estimate the global pose of a UAV and the absolute locations of some surrounding landmarks, using some relative measurements taken from a camera and an IMU.

We tested the performance of the observer for a UAV moving with a biased angular velociy denoted w in the code and a translational velocity denoted v in the code.
